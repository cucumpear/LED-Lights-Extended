	v. 1.0
A range of power-saving LED lights. A full rewrite of Loki88's LED Lights mod, which has been discontinued and can be found on the Ludeon forum. Textures were taken or adapted from Loki's mod.
Includes ceiling lights, rope lights, growing lamps and a medical lamp.
The medical lamp conflicts with mods that edit beds, loading such mods after LED Lights will remove the beds' ability to connect to the medical lamp.
I have provided a compatibility patch for Anonemous2's More Furniture mod.</description>
